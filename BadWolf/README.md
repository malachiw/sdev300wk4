This is part two of the week 2 Lab project.

I am to create my own web page that uses most of the functionality discussed in
this weeks lab--formatted text, hyperlinks, images, lists and forms. Forms do 
not have to be have to be functional.

The web page will
 1. Be well organized
 2. Provide a brief overview of a fictitious e-Commerce site and products
 3. List products with images, descriptions, and prices
 4. Have a minimum of 12 products
 5. Each product has a hyperlink that leads to more details about the product
    and is original
 6. Provide an order form including which products and quantity, firstName, 
    lastName,  street address, city, state, zipcode, and CC type, expiration 
    and security code
 7. Provide a place for user comments
 8. Be user friendly taking advantage of drop down list components, radio 
    buttons, and check boxes as appropriate.

I am to build in small increments and use tests that I can track by using the 
access.log along the way.
